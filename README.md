Requirements
-------------

- A web server with PHP
- A Flickr.com account
- A Flickr [API Key](http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/); presumably the non-commercial one will do.


Configuration and Setup
-------------

1. Open config/config.php and fill in your gallery title, username, and API key. Close and Save the file.
2. Upload the contents of /satellite/ files to a web server. You can put them into a sub-folder like yourdomain.com/photos/
3. Set the permissions of yourdomain.com/photos/cache to 777.
